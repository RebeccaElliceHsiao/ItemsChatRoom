To run the xcode chat app...
On the command line in the directory this README is in
(the same as Podfile), run

#$ pod install

Then in the same dir, run

#$ open omni.xcworkspace/

which will open the Xcode project.
Then just hit

# shift + Cmd + R

to run the project. That's it! Thanks for this fun project!
